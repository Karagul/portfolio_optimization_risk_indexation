# Portfolio Optimization Risk Indexation

Portfolio Optimization using different risk indexation techniques.

The implementation is based on Matlab R2019b, which is the minimum requirement
because of the use of tiledlayout() for plot layouting.

TODO:
- Implement SAA via sub-optimizations instead of one constraints matrix
- See notes
